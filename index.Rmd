> We continuously review and integrate the old iMAP [@TMBuza2019] with Snakemake and GitHub actions to facilitate reproducible microbiome data analysis!

<br><hr width=100%><br>

# General Overview

- We use the snakemake workflow management system [@Koster2021; @Snakemake2023] for:
  - Maintaining reproducibility in technical validation and regeneration of results.
  - Creating scalable data analysis scaled to server, grid or cloud environment.
  - Fostering sustainable improvement of the microbiome data analysis.
- We also review existing workflows [@Snakemake2023; @Mothursnakemake] to help in gaining a better insights for improving microbiome data analysis.
- We break any complex workflows into small contiguous but related chunks where each major step form a separate executable snakemake rule.

<br>

> We envision to keep fostering on continuous integration and development of highly reproducible workflows.

## Snakemake rule-graph
- Typically the snakemake workflow is defined by specifying rules.
- The rule-graph graphically shows the input-output files. 
- The snakemake is capable of automatically determining the dependencies between the rules and creates a dot-like DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

# Preliminary OTU Analysis using Mothur
> First initiate `mothur` then run the following commands on mothur cli to generate downstream input data.



# Appendix {-}

## Mothur reference databases
<ol>
  <li>Mothur-based SILVA reference files [@MothurSILVA]</li>.
  <li>Mothur-based RDP reference files [@MothurRDP]. Note: The RDP database is to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences to the genus level.</li>
  <li>ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard (Cat # D6306)[@Zymo2023]. The ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community DNA Standard is designed to assess bias, errors and other artifacts after the step of nucleic acid purification.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>

## Troubleshooting (in progress)
<ol>
  <li>Are chimeras removed by default in newer versions?</li>
    <ul>Yes. Chimeras are removed by default. You can still run the remove.seqs command without error, but it is not necessary. Remove chimera sequence explained [here](https://forum.mothur.org/t/chimera-vsearch-removes-groups-and-generates-empty-files/21342/4)</ul>.
  <li>Mothur dist.seqs taking too long.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Merged reads are too long, probably over 300pb.</li>
    <li>Reads not overlaping when merging the paired reads.</li>
    <li>Too many uniques representative sequences probably caused by lack of overlapping.</li>
    <li>No enough computer power which suggest a use of HPC or Cluster.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
